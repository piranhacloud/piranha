# Piranha

The Piranha module delivers you with a slim Servlet container, which
you can embed in your own application or use for whatever else you like.

Add the following dependency to your project to use it.

      <dependency>
          <groupId>cloud.piranha</groupId>
          <artifactId>piranha</artifactId>
          <version>x.y.z</version>
      </dependency>
