#
# IMPORTANT NOTE
#
# A Handler (in this case the ConsoleHandler) will only log up up to the level 
# specified for its Handler. So be default only INFO messages and higher will
# show up in the log. E.g if you want FINEST messages to show for a particular
# Logger you will have to set the level of the Handler to FINEST as well.
