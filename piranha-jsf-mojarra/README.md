The Manorrock Piranha Mojarra module delivers you with Mojarra integration.

Add the following dependency to your project to use it.

      <dependency>
          <groupId>com.manorrock.piranha</groupId>
          <artifactId>piranha-jsf-mojarra</artifactId>
          <version>x.y.z</version>
      </dependency>

Make sure you use the same version of Manorrock Piranha itself.

Note that this example does not set the &lt;scope&gt; but depending on what you
are using Manorrock Piranha for you might need to add a &lt;scope&gt;.
