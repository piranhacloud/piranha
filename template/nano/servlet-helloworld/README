  ======

  This project has been setup to build and run your Servlet locally
  on port 8080 using the DefaultHttpServer. Feel free to customize
  it to your needs.

  To build the project use the following Maven command-line:

    mvn clean install

  After the build you can find the JLink image in the target/runtime
  directory. Be aware that the resulting image is OS specific.

  Note the Piranha version in the POM file is dependent on the version of the
  Piranha CLI used. If you want to update it to the latest Piranha version use
  the following Maven command-line:

    mvn versions:update-property -Dproperty=piranha.version

  If you have any questions and/or suggestions feel free to leave
  them as issues with the 'cli' label at the GitHub issue tracker at:
