# Getting Started

## What distribution should I use?

The short answer is that it depends on your needs. 

If you want to embed Piranha into your application you can pick Piranha Embedded to start embedding Piranha directly into your own application.

If you are looking for a lean REST runtime then you should pick Piranha Core Profile. 

If you are looking for a traditional Servlet container, similar to Tomcat and Jetty, then Piranha Server or Piranha Servlet are your best bet. For hosting multiple web applications on the same distribution use Piranha Server. For hosting just a single web application pick Piranha Servlet.
